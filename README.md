This project is an online CV generator based on a JSON file, allowing anyone to create and customize their own résumé by simply editing the JSON file. Key features include:

- **Printable**: The CV is optimized for printing.
- **PDF Download**: Easily download the CV in PDF format with one click.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Offers the option to switch between dark and light themes for better accessibility and personalization.

### Inspiration

This project is based on the original idea by [Bartosz Jarocki](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki/cv), which uses a JSON file as the source for the CV. The design is inspired by [midudev’s project](https://github.com/midudev/minimalist-portfolio-json).

### Added Features

- Dark and light modes.
- Option to download the CV in PDF format.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
